Unfortunately, this does not work. The official go_library rules still suffer
from some dependency-related issues, where the Go library generated from a
proto A that depends on proto B will not correctly get the dependency on the Go
library generated from B.

This is more or less what the "hack" I just deleted was doing. I might have to
see if I can replicate the hack.
