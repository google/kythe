Kythe Compilation ZIP Format (.kzip)
====================================
Michael J. Fromberger <fromberger@google.com>
v.0.1.0, 18-May-2018: Draft
:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:priority: 500

== Summary

This document specifies a compact persistent storage representation for
compilation records, suitable for use by Kythe to generate cross-reference data
and to apply other static analysis tools to source files.

The format described below replaces the storage formats described in the
link:http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-index-pack.html[Kythe index pack format]
specification. Unlike an indexpack, the kzip format does not directly support
concurrent writers. As far as we know, no one has made any use of this feature.
If necessary, the directory structure of a kzip is such that writers may
construct the tree concurrently using the same strategy, and then pack the
results into a ZIP file after the fact. The only differences are that the
stored files are not compressed individually, and the filename suffixes used by
the indexpack format are dropped.

== Background

To generate cross-references, Kythe captures a record of each compilation that
is to be indexed (_e.g.,_ a library or binary) with enough information to
enable us to replay the compilation to the front-end of the compiler.  This
record consists of a
`CompilationUnit` link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[protobuf]
message, together with the content of all the source files and other inputs the
compiler needs to process the compilation (_e.g.,_ header files or type
snapshots from dependencies).

== Kythe ZIP Format (.kzip)

To store compilation records compactly, we use a specially formatted ZIP
archive that we call a *kzip* file, conventionally given the file extension
`.kzip`. A kzip file consists of the following directory structure:

[literal]
root/           # Any valid non-empty directory name
   units/
     abcd1234   # Compilation unit (see below for format)
     …          # (name is hex-coded SHA256 of record content)
   files/
     1a2b3c4e   # File contents, uncompressed
     …          # (name is hex-coded SHA256 of uncompressed file content)


This organization separates the compilation unit descriptions from their file
data, which are shared among multiple compilations.

=== Directory and File Layout

A kzip is a ZIP file containing a top-level root directory that contains two
subdirectories, one named `units` and one named `files`.

 * The `units` subdirectory may contain only unit files.

 * The `files` subdirectory may contain only data files.

 * Other files or directories inside the `units` or `files` subdirectories
   should cause a tool to consider the kzip file invalid.

 * Other files or subdirectories in the root or other subdirectories should be
   ignored by a tool processing the kzip file.

A *unit file* is a file containing a compilation unit description.  The name of
a unit file is computed by digesting the compilation unit with SHA256, and
encoding the resulting hash as a string of lowercase ASCII hexadecimal
digits. This string becomes the filename of the unit file.

A *data file* is a file containing an unstructured blob of raw (uncompressed)
file data.  The name name of a data file is computed by hashing the file
contents with SHA256, and encoding the resulting hash as a string of lowercase
ASCII hexadecimal digits. This string becomes the filename of the data file.

The *root directory* must be the first entry in the ZIP file, and its name must
not be empty.

=== Compilation Unit Description Format

The content of a unit file is the canonical JSON encoding of a
`kythe.proto.IndexedCompilation` protobuf message.

[source,javascript]
{
   "unit": <encoded kythe.proto.CompilationUnit>,
   "index": {
      "revision": ["123", "456", "789"]
   }
}

The `"unit"` key is required, and must contain the canonical JSON encoding of a
`kythe.proto.CompilationUnit` protobuf message.  The `"index"` key is optional,
but if set must contain the canonical JSON encoding of an `Index` message.
