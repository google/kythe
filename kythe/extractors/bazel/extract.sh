# Usage:
# extract.sh \
#     --define kythe_corpus=github.com/project/repo \
#     //...
#
# Input `kythe_corpus` should be the repository you're extracting (for example
# github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf), as well as the build target to extract.
# A good default is //..., which extracts almost everything.
#
# Note that this doesn't some targets - for example build targets with
# `tags = ["manual"]` will not be extracted.  If you have  additional targets to
# extract those can be appended cleanly:
#
#     extract.sh --define... //... //some/manual:target
#
# If you have restrictions on what can or should be extracted, for example an
# entire directory to ignore, you must specify your partitions individually.  A
# good tool for doing this (instead of manually discovering everything) is bazel
# query, described at
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query-how-to.html.
#
# Outputs $KYTHE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/compilations.kzip
#
# Requires having environment variable $KYTHE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY set, as well
# as kzip tool (kythe/go/platform/tools/kzip) installed to /kythe/kzip and
# kythe/release/base/fix_permissions.sh copied to /kythe/fix_permissions.sh.
# Also assumes you have extractors installed as per
# kythe/extractors/bazel/extractors.bazelrc.
