# Rust Hello World (Vendored)

This is an example Rust project that is built using Bazel's [Rust rules](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust).  

Dependencies are managed using [cargo-raze](https://github.com/google/cargo-raze) in [Vendoring Mode](https://github.com/google/cargo-raze#vendoring-mode).

## Building using Bazel
First, install cargo-raze:
```shell
$ cargo install cargo-raze
```
Enter the `cargo` directory:
```shell
$ cd cargo
```
Vendor the dependencies:
```shell
$ cargo vendor --versioned-dirs --locked
```
Generate the necessary files using cargo-raze:
```shell
$ cargo raze
```
Go back to the base directory:
```shell
$ cd ..
```
Build and run the :hello_world target using Bazel:
```shell
bazel run //:hello_world
```
## Note
Normally, the BUILD file generated by cargo-raze and the vendored dependencies would be checked into source control.
However, they are being ignored to avoid unnecessary bloat.
