# Dockerfile for packaging up extractrepo.
#
# You must first build extractrepo using bazel before trying to build this
# image:
#
# $ bazel build kythe/go/platforms/tools/extraction/extractrepo:extractrepo
# $ cp bazel-bin/kythe/go/platform/tools/extraction/extractrepo/linux_amd64_stripped/extractrepo kythe/go/platform/tools/extraction/extractrepo
# $ docker build --tag test-extract kythe/go/platform/tools/extraction/extractrepo/.
# $ docker run -i --volume /tmp/input --volume /tmp/output -v ~/some/mvn/repo:/tmp/repo -v /tmp/output:/tmp/output -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -t test-extract
#
# It will deposit .kindex files into /tmp/output.
