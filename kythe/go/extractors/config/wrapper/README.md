# Kythe Extractor Wrapping

This package contains resources for preprocessing a repository's build
configuration before running Kythe Extraction via `extractrepo.go`.

## Gradle

`gradle_build_modifier.go` takes an input `gradle.build` file and appends the
bits necessary for replacing javac calls with Kythe's `javac-wrapper.sh`.

```
allprojects {
  gradle.projectsEvaluated {
    tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
      options.fork = true
      options.forkOptions.executable = '/opt/kythe/extractors/javac-wrapper.sh'
    }
  }
}
```

If the input file already contains reference to
`options.forkOptions.executable`, then `gradle_build_modifier.go` does nothing.

### Future work

The current implementation uses some simple file parsing, without actually
understanding the structure.  If that becomes necessary in the future, it might
be better to use the existing java libraries for `org.codehaus.groovy.ast` to
properly parse the build.gradle file and have more precise picture.  In
particular `org.codehaus.groovy.ast.CodeVisitorSupport` might be sufficient.

## Maven

Maven is handled in java by
`com.google.devtools.kythe.platform.tools.MvnPomPreprocessor`.  It utilizes an
xml library to parse and modify the mvn `pom.xml` config file in a similar way
as described above for gradle.

### Future work

In theory if we can find a nice xml library for golang that supports reflecting
into specific elements and modifying without knowing the whole file structure,
then we could do away with the java binary for maven preprocessing.

## CMake

Coming soonâ„¢.

## Bazel

Actually we have no custom work here.  The logic was as follows:

1. We already have a substantial pipeline using bazel extractor, so it should
   "just work"

2. Not many external projects use bazel, so we're targeting
   maven/gradle/cmake/etc first.
