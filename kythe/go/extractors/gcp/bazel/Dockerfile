# Build: bazel build //kythe/go/extractors/gcp/bazel:artifacts
# Usage:
#   This container houses bazel extraction artifacts which are necessary for
#   extracting a bazel repo.  It includes a script for modifying a repo's
#   WORKSPACE in /opt/kythe/extractors/setup-bazel-repo.sh, as well as an
#   installed copy of the kythe repo at /opt/kythe/repo/kythe.
#
#   From commandline:
#     docker run -it --entrypoint "/bin/sh" gcr.io/kythe-public/kythe-bazel-extractor-artifacts
#
#   From Google Cloud Build:
#     - name: 'gcr.io/kythe-public/kythe-bazel-extractor-artifacts'
#       volumes:
#         - name: 'kythe_extractors'
